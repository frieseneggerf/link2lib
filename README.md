**Lib Proxy Helper** lets you easily access paywalled research articles, provided (1) **your library has licenced them** and (2) offers access via a proxy prefix solution like EZProxy.

## How it works
Many academic libraries provide off-campus access to their licensed content for their users via a proxy server. This is usually a simple url snippet (e.g. `https://proxy.university.example/login?q=`) that can be prepended to a link to an article you want to access. You are then redirected to login at your library and can read the article. All this app does is semi-automate the process of prepending the proxy url.

## Features
- Pass article links to the app via the system share function or your clipboard
- Configure certain publisher domains to be automatically handled when clicked
- View a history of your accessed links
- Manage multiple different proxy prefixes
- Doesn't require you to grant any permissions and can't access the internet itself
- Free and open source
